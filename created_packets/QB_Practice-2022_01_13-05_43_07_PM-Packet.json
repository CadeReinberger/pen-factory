The Briggs Haldane derivation of a relation governing these molecules uses the free ligand and (*) steady-state approximations. These molecules, which irreversibly form covalent bonds with suicide inhibitors, may require cofactors to function, and their active sites bind to substrates in the lock-and-key or induced fit models. K-cat, the turnover number, characterizes their efficiency, and is equal to V-max over the concentration of these molecules. Those constants appear in the Michaelis Menten equation for the kinetics of these molecules. For 10 points, name these ubiquitous biological catalysts.",
