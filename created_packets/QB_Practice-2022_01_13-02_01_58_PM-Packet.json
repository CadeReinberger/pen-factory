      "question_sanitized": "This period was initiated by the publication of a proclamation in a newspaper whose name translates as \"The Calendar of Events,\" and that proclamation was considered by Lord Kinross to be its nation's Magna Carta. This period was followed by a two-year-long period usually known as the \"First Constitutional Era.\" During this period, the Council of Justice rose to national prominence, while the ambassador Stratford Canning (*) emerged as an important protector of religious minorities in the nation in which this period occurred. The focus of the two major documents issued during this period was conscription, tax collection, and legal equality, and the developments of this period were largely administered by Mustafa Reshid, who is generally considered its \"father.\" This period was initiated in 1839 with the Imperial Rescript of Gulhane issued by Abdulmecit I, and continued in the 1856 Hatt-i Humayun decree.
